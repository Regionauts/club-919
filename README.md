Podcsting home of In The Fighting Hole, a Marine centered exploration of Service as a Marine, news and announcement platform for the Marine Corps League and Marine For Life Network.
Well, I gotta do something with this montrostity of a Wordpress cobble together thing I have created without any real planning or success as I discovered when I had my mentor examine it. Anyhoo, trying to make it all better now or when I start podcasting, Ill be the embarrassment of the entire Marine Corps League!
